# TASK 01

This repository contains the full work for **Task 01: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**.

Objective: Clean and prepare a raw dataset (with nulls, duplicates, inconsistent formats).

Tools: Excel/ Python(Pandas).

## Included:
- Raw dataset
- Cleaned dataset
- Python cleaning script
- Jupyter notebook
- Complete explanation in README

The raw dataset, containing student stress-related factors, was thoroughly inspected to identify missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and irregular column naming conventions.

Through a structured cleaning process—standardizing column names, validating data types, removing unwanted characters, and ensuring overall consistency—the dataset was transformed into a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready format.

All work, including the raw and cleaned datasets, Python automation script, Jupyter notebook, and supporting screenshots, is documented and organized within the repository, demonstrating a strong understanding of essential data preprocessing techniques used in real-world analytics workflows.
